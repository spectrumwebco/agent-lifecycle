## Via DevPod Desktop Application

Navigate to the 'Providers' view and click on the trash icon of the provider
you want to remove.

If a workspace is currently using the provider, you'll be prompted to first
remove that workspace, in order to then remove the provider.

## Via DevPod CLI

An already installed provider can be removed by using:

```sh
devpod provider delete <provider name>
```

:::warning
⚠️ **BE CAREFUL**:⚠️
Remember first to delete any workspace related to this provider first, or move
them to another provider, else you'll not be able to interact with the workspace
until you re-install the provider used.
